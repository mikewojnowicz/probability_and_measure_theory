\section{Section 1.2: Fields, \sfs, measures}

\subsection{Sec 1.2.1-1.2.2: Fields and \sfs}

Fields and \sfs\ are important because they are the domain of measures.  Here are some definitions.

\begin{definition}
Let $\F$ be a collection of subsets of a set $\Omega$.  Then $\F$ is called a \textbf{field} (or \textit{algebra})  if 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item $\Omega \in \F$ 
	\item If $A \in \F$, then $A^c \in \F$.
	\item If $A_1,...A_n \in \F$ then $\cup_{i=1}^n A_i \in \F$. 
\end{enumerate}
that is, if $\Omega \in \F$ and $\F$ is closed under complementation and finite unions.
\label{def:field}	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\F$ be a collection of subsets of a set $\Omega$.  Then $\F$ is called a \textbf{sigma-field} (or \textit{sigma-algebra}) if it satisfies Definition \ref{def:field} after replacing condition c) with

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[c')] If $A_1,A_2, ... \in \F$ then $\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \F$. 
\end{enumerate}
that is, if $\Omega \in \F$ and $\F$ is closed under complementation and \textit{countable} unions.
\label{def:sigma-field}	
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
$\F =\set{\emptyset, \Omega}$ is the smallest \sf\ on $\Omega$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	$\F =2^\Omega$, i.e. the set of all subsets of $\Omega$, is the largest \sf\ on $\Omega$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If $A \in \Omega$ is non-empty, then $\F = \set{\emptyset, A, A^c, \Omega}$ is the smallest \sf\ containing $A$.
\end{example}

\begin{notation}
If $\C$ is a class of sets, the smallest \sf\ containing the sets of $\C$ is written as $\sigma(\C$).  This is sometimes called the \textit{minimal \sf\ over $C$} or the \textit{\sf\ generated by $C$}. 
\end{notation}
	
\begin{question}
Let $A_1,...,A_n$ be subsets of $\Omega$.  Describe $\sigma(\set{A_1,...,A_n})$, the smallest \sf\ containing $A_1,...,A_n$.  Also describe the number of sets in $\F$.   \textit{This is Ash's Problem 1.2.8.  For answer, see GoodNotes.}	
\end{question}

\begin{example} What is an example of a collection that is a \textit{field}, but not a $\sigma$-\textit{field}?  

Let $\Omega=\R$ and $\F_0 = \set{\text{finite disjoint unions of } [a,b), a \neq b}$.  Then $\F_0$ is a field, as can be easily verified.   But $\F_0$ is \underline{not} a \sf.  Note that if $A_n = [0,\frac{1}{n})$, then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n = \set{0}  \not\in \F_0$.
	
\end{example}

\subsubsection{``Good sets" strategy}

Ash says that there is a type of reasoning that occurs so often in problems involving \sfs that it deserves explicit mention.  It is called the \textit{good sets strategy}.   Suppose you want to show that all members of a $\sigma$-algebra   $\F$ have some property $P$.  Define ``good sets" as those that satisfy the property
\[ \G := \{ G \in \F : G \text{ has property } P \} \]
The strategy is then to simply
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show $\G$ is a $\sigma$-algebra 
\item Show $\G$ contains some class $\C$ such that $\F = \sigma(\C)$	
\end{enumerate}


Then you're done!  

Why does this work?

\begin{align*}
& \quad \C \subset \G &&	\text{by 2}\\
&\implies \sigma(\C) \subset \sigma(\G) &&  \\
&\implies \F \subset \G && \text{by 1,2} \\
& \text{Yet $\G \subset \F$ by definition of $\G$.} && \\
& \text{So $\G = \F$.} && \\
& \text{ So all sets in $\F$ are good.} && \\
\end{align*}

In the text, Ash uses this strategy to show that if $\C$ is a class of subsets of $\Omega$, and $A \in \Omega$, then

\[ \explaintermbrace{take minimal sigma field first, then intersect}{\sigma_\Omega(\C) \cap A} = \explaintermbrace{intersect first, then take minimal sigma-field}{\sigma_A(\C \cap A)} \]

 For another application, see handwritten homework exercises.	

\subsection{Sec 1.2.3-1.2.8: Measures, related set functions, and their properties}




\begin{definition}
A \textbf{measure} on a \sf\ $\F$ is a non-negative, extended real-valued function $\mu$ on $\F$ such that whenever $A_1, A_2, ...$ form a finite or countably infinite collection of disjoint sets in $\F$, we have countable additivity; that is,
\[ \mu \bigg( \bigcupdot_n A_n \bigg) = \ds\sum_n \mu(A_n) \]
\label{def:measure}	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{probability measure} is a measure (Definition \ref{def:measure}) where $\mu(\Omega)=1$.
\label{def:prob_measure}		
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}{\remarktitle{Measure-like functions on fields}}
A measure-like set function can be defined on \textit{fields} as well as \textit{sigma-fields} if the countable additivity condition is taken to hold whenever a countable unions \textit{does} happen to still be in the field.  	
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Ash additionally assumes that a measure does not take $\mu(A) = \infty$ or $\mu(A) = -\infty$ for all $A \in \F$.  From this, we automatically obtain $\mu(\emptyset)=0$. For $\mu(A) < \infty$ for some $A$, and by considering the sequence $A, \emptyset, \emptyset, ...$, we have that $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ by countable additivity.
